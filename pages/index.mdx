Physical Abdominal Examination Device
for Remote/Non-face-to-face Diagnosis in a Metaverse Hospital.

## Problems

1. Conventional palpation methods rely heavily on individual experience and skill.
2. Existing scoring methods(Alvarado, AIR) are time consuming because they require additional blood/lab work.
3. Smaller clinics lack the equipment and personnel necessary for imaging (CT, US).

## Goals

1. Automated measuring using a self-actuated mechanism.
2. Collect quantitative data for force applied and rebound tenderness.
3. Plug-and-play, step-by-step guided device that can be used by anyone.
